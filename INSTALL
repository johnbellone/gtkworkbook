GTKWorkbook Installation Guide

This file contains general information on the installation of GTKWorkbook.
Right now there are not any build tools used other than GNU Make so
dependency checking must be done manually. In the future this will change
but I do not have the time to get acquantied with automake yet.

DEPENDENCIES

	A. GTK	

	   This is obvious but I figured I should state it anyway. 
	   	
	B. GtkExtra

	   The libworkbook library wraps GTK+ calls to the GtkSheet widget
	   which is included inside of the GtkExtra library available on
	   the FEDORA REPOSITORY, and the SOURCEFORGE.NET project website.
	   
	   I have been performing development on gtkextra3 and gtkextra2
	   which both work with GTKWorkbook; but I would suggest downloading
	   the latest version of either depending on which version of GTK+
	   you have installed. You can use their CVS repository on their
	   project's website:

	   http://gtkextra.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gtkextra

	C. Pixman

	   The GtkExtra library requires this to be installed with the version	
	   of GTK+ that ships with CentOS 5.2; but later versions of Fedora 
	   seem to include this in their distribution. If you are using either
	   CentOS 5.2 (or the equivalient RedHat distribution) you'll need to
	   grab this release and go through the motions.

	   http://cairographics.org/releases/

	   The newest version should suffice as long as it compiles and installs.

	D. libcsv

	   This C library is used for the parsing of comma-separated files that are
	   used for all of the major modes of this application. It is a very solid
	   library, and the most recent version is more than suitable for the demo
	   code.

	   It is available off sourceforge.net at the following address:

	   http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/

        E. GNU Autotools

           This is the build tool-chain used which must be available. I have not come
           across a version of Linux that does not have this installed. The code has been
           tested and successfully built on the latest version of Ubuntu (9.04) and the
           current version of CentOS 5.2 and RHEL as of this writing (September 2009). 

BASIC INSTALLATION

      The build system has moved to using GNU autotools. Most of the quirks have been worked
      out and a simple script has been introduced to streamline the build process for testing.
      Because of the structure of the autotools builds without this script the files will not
      be copied over into the bin/ directory.

      1. Run ./autogen.sh

      2. ./build.sh all

      3. ./bin/gtkworkbook -c ./bin/application.cfg

ADVANCED INSTALLATION
      
      You can specify an installation directory by re-running autogen.sh, but when you build
      without using the custom build.sh script remember that the bin/ binary (and extensions)
      will not be copied over.

      1. Run ./autogen.sh --prefix=[install_directory]
 
      2. make install

      3. cd [install_directory]

      4. gtkworkbook -c application.cfg
