UBUNTU 9.10
	- As of October 20th 2009 the current trunk version of GTKWorkbook 
	does not work with the beta release of Ubuntu 9.10. This has to do
	seemingly with changes made to the underlying Gnome libraries.

	- The problem exists in the required dependency of GtkExtra which 
	seems to directly use structures that may have been deprecated. More
	investigation will need to be done.

	- This may be the case with FEDORA 12 as it will most likely be using
	the same (or newer) Gnome subsystem.
