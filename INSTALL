GTKWorkbook Installation Guide

This file contains general information on the installation of GTKWorkbook.
Right now there are not any build tools used other than GNU Make so
dependency checking must be done manually. In the future this will change
but I do not have the time to get acquantied with automake yet.

DEPENDENCIES

	A. GTK	

	   This is obvious but I figured I should state it anyway. 
	   	
	B. GtkExtra

	   The libworkbook library wraps GTK+ calls to the GtkSheet widget
	   which is included inside of the GtkExtra library available on
	   the FEDORA REPOSITORY, and the SOURCEFORGE.NET project website.
	   
	   I have been performing development on gtkextra3 and gtkextra2
	   which both work with GTKWorkbook; but I would suggest downloading
	   the latest version of either depending on which version of GTK+
	   you have installed. You can use their CVS repository on their
	   project's website:

	   http://gtkextra.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gtkextra

	C. Pixman

	   The GtkExtra library requires this to be installed with the version	
	   of GTK+ that ships with CentOS 5.2; but later versions of Fedora 
	   seem to include this in their distribution. If you are using either
	   CentOS 5.2 (or the equivalient RedHat distribution) you'll need to
	   grab this release and go through the motions.

	   http://cairographics.org/releases/

	   The newest version should suffice as long as it compiles and installs.

	D. libcsv

	   This C library is used for the parsing of comma-separated files that are
	   used for all of the major modes of this application. It is a very solid
	   library, and the most recent version is more than suitable for the demo
	   code.

	   It is available off sourceforge.net at the following address:

	   http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/

BASIC INSTALLATION

      The build system has begun to move to a GNU autotools design. There are still
      a few quirks about how the system works, but all in all it is much like any other
      open source project that uses the GNU tool chain. There is a configure script that
      can be run independently to build the set of Makefiles, but a custom autogen.sh
      script is included for ease of use.

      One limitiation to the build system is that it is designed with the purpose of
      installing the application. Right now there is no easy way to build the code into	
      a sensible directory structure (bin/, lib/, etc) without severe modification. In
      the future the code will most likely be restructured further to ease the transition
      to newer versions, but for now it is compilable.

      Please make sure all the dependencies are installed before building.

      1. Run ./autogen.sh --prefix=[install_directory]

      2. make install

      3. cd [install_directory]
      
      4. ./bin/gtkworkbook -c ./cfg/application.cfg
