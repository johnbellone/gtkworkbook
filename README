The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install
GTKWorkbook on various systems, and if you are reading this document we are
making the assumption that you have the whole source tree.

See the file etc/NEWS for information on new features, and other user-visible
changes in the recent versions of GTKWorkbook.

The file etc/PROBLEMS contains information on common problems that may occur
during the use of GTKWorkbook, which may include, compiling, runtime, and
writing extensions.

The file etc/BUGS contains known bugs that are being worked on. If you find
any bugs please report them on sourceforge.net so that they can be added
to the queue.

`etc'		holds miscellaneous files that are useful for development purposes but
       		not critical to the application itself. 

`src' 		holds the C/C++ code for the GTKWorkbook application.

`gtkworkbook' 	contains the library built to abstract away the calls to the
	      	GtkSheet widget available in the required GtkExtra+ package.

`cfg' 		has the demonstration's configuration file that must be loaded in order
		for the application to launch properly.

`include'	is where the includes for the shared libraries are
