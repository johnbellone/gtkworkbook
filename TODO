TODO for Autotools branch

* Autotools
	- Bugs
		o Object files currently build into directory with Makefile. Ideally they
		should be built into hidden .obj directory just as .lib and .dep. 
		o Binaries (including libraries) do not get copied into the /bin/ file of
		the project's root
	- Before Merge
		o Checks for proper version of GTK+, GtkExtra, and Pixman. 
	- Merge
		o This should be a clean merge into master branch.
		o This branch should then be deleted, recreated, and merged into largefile.
