John Bellone <jvb4@njit.edu>

OPERATING SYSTEM

	This software has been tested on the following operating systems and 
	verified to work correctly:

	UBUNTU 9.04
	CENTOS 5.x
	RHEL 5.x

	This software has been tested on the following operating systems and 
	found to NOT work correctly:

	UBUNTU 9.10 
		* due to underlying Gnome changes that affect GtkExtra package

UNIT/REGRESSION TESTING

	The choice has been made to go with Google's C++ Testing framework 
	that is available for free from http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

	In order to run the tests you will need to properly install the Google
	Test framework on your system. GTKWorkbook will check to make sure that
	the "gtest-config" script is available before it will run any tests.
