Testing

This software has been tested on the following systems and verified to work 
correctly:

UBUNTU 9.04
CENTOS 5.2 (via Sun Virtualbox)
CENTOS 5.1 (via Sun Virtualbox)

       - Intel Core Quad 2.8GHZ
       - 8GB memory
       - 500GB hard-drive space
       
RHEL (as of September 2009)

       - Intel Xeon 2.4GHZ
       - 16GB memory
       - 500GB hard-drive space

Right now there is no official test suite, the plan is to eventually add a
regression test for libgtkworkbook, but for right now we have included the 
python scripts that are used for testing. If you look inside of the `etc'
directory you can find scripts to start TCP socket sessions, pull information
down from Yahoo's finance website, and generate large CSV files.
