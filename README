GTKWorkbook README
------------------

0. Project Website

	The project has moved to sourceforge.net:

	http://gtkworkbook.sourceforge.net/

	The subversion repository has moved there as well:

	https://gtkworkbook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gtkworkbook
	
1. Installation
	
	Please see the INSTALL file in the root directory of the project for
	more details on how to properly install this project.

2. License
	
	There should be a file entitled LICENSE in the root directory of the
	project. All of the code, unless otherwise specified, is licensed
	under the GNU Lesser General Public License 2.1. There may be
	individual scripts or files that are licensed under the GNU General
	Public License 2, but those should be far and few between.

	The <libcsv> library included is licensed under the LGPL 2.1 and all
	the documentation information is included in the library's directory.

3. Documentation
	
	Most of the library code is commented pretty well, but much of the
	example application code has not been documented yet. Any specific
	questions should be directly asked on the project's forum on the
	sourceforge.net website.

	In the future there will be an API PDF. 

4. Contact
	
	The best means of contact would be through the sourceforge.net project
	website (information at the top of this document) but if it is urgent
	then you may contact me directly via email.
