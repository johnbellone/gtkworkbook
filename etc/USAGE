GTKWORKBOOK

	KEYBOARD

	`F2' - "Record view" transposes rows to columns from any number of 
	selected rows. A new window, as well as workbook, is created to 
	facilitate this feature. 

LARGEFILE

	KEYBOARD

		`F1' - "Goto" or "jump" options that allow for quickly 
		paging through a large file utilizng one of the three options. 

		(Byte offset) - You can manually specify an byte offset and
		receive the immediate _next line_ from that specified offset.

		(Absolute line) - An indexer runs in the background and must
		go completely through the file in order to get an exact line
		index. As the index becomes available you are able to specify
		an absolute line number. The index time depends on (a) the
		size of the file in question, (b) the version of Linux, and
		the (c) computer's hardware itself. 

		(Percentage) - You can quickly jump to a relative percentage
		of the file. This is based strictly on the _byte offset_ and
		is calculated by taking the size of the file in question.

	MOUSE

		The "Largefile" menu item at the top allows for a dialog to
		be opened to browse, and open, a CSV file. 
		
REALTIME

	When the plugin is first initialized a TCP server is started on a port
	specified inside of the configuration file. This is open on the main
	ethernet and allows for "control" over the application's sheets, cells,
	and workbooks. 

	MOUSE

		The "Realtime" menu item at the top allows for a dialog to
		be opened to create a TCP client connect to a server that
		streams CSV information.
