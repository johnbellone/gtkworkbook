GTKWorkbook Installation
------------------------

0.	Testing Systems

	CentOS 5.2 (Redhat)
	GCC 4.1.2
	Python 2.4.3

1. 	Requirements

	A. GtkExtra

	The libworkbook library wraps the GTK+ calls to the GtkSheet widget
	which is included inside of the GtkExtra library available on
	sourceforge.net. Due to the age of the gtkextra2 release I would
	highly suggest downloading directly from the CVS repository.

	http://gtkextra.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gtkextra/gtkextra-2/

	B. Pixman

	The GtkExtra library requires this to be installed with the version
	of GTK that ships with CentOS 5.2. I believe that it is available with
	newer versions of GTK, but here is the location of the repository if
	you need to find it. Grab the newest release, compile and install.

	http://cairographics.org/releases/
		
2.	Installation

	Once all of the dependencies (above) have been installed you can
	finally get on to the fun stuff. The compliation of the project is
	rather easy (and quick).

	Inside of the root directory of the project, type:

	make clean all

	If you wish to install:

	make clean install
