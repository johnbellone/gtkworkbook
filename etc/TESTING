Testing

Unless otherwise specified testing has been done via Sun's VirtualBox virtual machine software. This lets me quickly
test the different configurations that are needed for each branch of the project. If you have any specific problems
with runtime (or compliation) please remember to indicate if you are running it in a virtual machine, which software,
and any other information that may be needed (version of GTK+, etc).
