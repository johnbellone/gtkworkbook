GTKWorkbook Installation Guide

This file contains general information on the installation of GTKWorkbook.
Right now there are not any build tools used other than GNU Make so
dependency checking must be done manually. In the future this will change
but I do not have the time to get acquantied with automake yet.

DEPENDENCIES

	A. GTK	

	   This is obvious but I figured I should state it anyway. 
	   	
	B. GtkExtra

	   The libworkbook library wraps GTK+ calls to the GtkSheet widget
	   which is included inside of the GtkExtra library available on
	   the FEDORA REPOSITORY, and the SOURCEFORGE.NET project website.
	   
	   I have been performing development on gtkextra3 and gtkextra2
	   which both work with GTKWorkbook; but I would suggest downloading
	   the latest version of either depending on which version of GTK+
	   you have installed. You can use their CVS repository on their
	   project's website:

	   http://gtkextra.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gtkextra

	C. Pixman

	   The GtkExtra library requires this to be installed with the version	
	   of GTK+ that ships with CentOS 5.2; but later versions of Fedora 
	   seem to include this in their distribution. If you are using either
	   CentOS 5.2 (or the equivalient RedHat distribution) you'll need to
	   grab this release and go through the motions.

	   http://cairographics.org/releases/

	   The newest version should suffice as long as it compiles and installs.

BASIC INSTALLATION

      So as I stated before my build system merely uses some shell commands, and a
      set of Makefiles. I do not use automake as of the writing of this document
      therefore some care may have to be taken when linking dependencies. The only
      issue I have ran into is that YUM properly installs GtkExtra include files
      into: /usr/include instead of /usr/local/include

      This can be easily (and quickly) changed inside of the Makefile.base which 
      has a specific include line for the GtkExtra headers. Once this change is
      made and as long as the dependencies have all been installed you are ready
      to rock on compliation/installation of this project.

      1. Copy the .gtkworkbook file from the project directory, and change the
      paths to where you would like the compiled libraries to be installed to
      and where your project directory is located.

      You will get compliation errors if your project directory is not correct.

      2. make clean all

      3. Modify the application.cfg file inside of the `bin' directory to account
      for any changes for the application; this includes the absolute path of the
      example .so files.

      4. The binaries and .so files are located in the `bin' directory for testing.

      5. Execute with ./bin/gtkworkbook -c ./bin/application.cfg and enjoy!

ADVANCED INSTALLATION

 	 If you have plans to install the application in a separate directory than
	 the .so plugin files be sure to remember that the application.cfg input
	 file must point to the absolute path of the individual files. Relative paths
	 will work but are currently tied to the execution path of the binary.
